This is a repository of API for Tresure Application using Express.js, Prisma, and MySQL. This project aims to develop an API that can be used to interact with data in MySQL databases.

![User Api](https://github.com/Tresure-Bangkit2023/backend-tresure/blob/main/cloudarchi.png?raw=true)

## Description
This project uses Express.js as a framework for developing APIs. Express.js allows you to easily create API routes, handle HTTP requests, and organize application business logic.

Prisma is used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with MySQL database. With Prisma, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data efficiently.

MySQL is used as a relational database management system (RDBMS) that will store and manage application data. We also use Cloud Storage from Google Cloud Platform for store our image data.

## Features
- Provides CRUD operations to manage data in the database.
- Integrate with machine learning model API to obtain tourist destination recommendations.
- Access restriction by using JWT (JSON Web Token) to protect specific endpoints and ensure security in the API.

## API Documentation
